# VerifPlayer
VerifPlayer is a Minecraft plugin, based on the PaperSpigot api. It is compatible with spigot.
It offers an interface for moderators with a lot of interesting information about each player such as his inventory, his life, his potion effects. The novelty of this project is that it also displays the CPS (clicks per second) of the players.
It also offers tools to observe the players and do actions like preventing them from moving, testing their retreat during an attack, teleporting to them; all while being invisible. 

## Version
Originally created for minecraft 1.8.8, it has been updated for version 1.15.2. It is in theory cross-versions (officially works from 1.8 to 1.15). The recommended version is 1.15.

## Status of projet
The project has been abandoned since, and has not been updated for the latest version of Minecraft. We are looking for contributors to update the project.
